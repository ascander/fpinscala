  /**
    * Exercise 7.3 - Hard: Fix the implementation of `map2` so that it
    * respects the contract of timeouts on Future.
    *
    * Note that this solution makes the design choice to treat time remaining as state associated with calling `get` on
    * a `Future` - this is abstracted out by creating a new implementation `TimedFuture[A]` which provides a new method
    * called `getWithRemaining` that returns a tuple consisting of the result, and remaining time and units.
    *
    * While this solution is elegant in its treatment of `get` as a stateful computation, it forces us to deal with the
    * specification of the timeout in our call to `map2`. The solution below just explicitly asserts it in the body of
    * the function, which clearly won't work in general. The options are to either push it to the front of the call to
    * `map2`, or change the signature of `map2` to accept a timeout in addition. Both of these options have drawbacks.
    *
    * The crucial insight to make here is that a) callers of `map2` are going to have to call `get` on its result at
    * some point anyway, if they want the contents, and that b) the necessary components of respecting timeouts requires
    * both the `Future[A]` yielded by `a` and the `Future[B]` yielded by `b`. This allows for a different implementation
    * of `Future[T]` that wraps both futures as well as the function `f` to apply to their results.
    *
    * See the `map2WithTimeoutsBookSolution` for details on the optimal approach.
