/**
  * The makeup of an _Algebraic Data Type_ (ADT) is generally as follows:
  *
  *   - a sealed trait representing the data type
  *   - objects and/or classes to extend the sealed trait
  *
  * In the example below, we implement a singly-linked list as an ADT. Linked lists are exhaustively represented as
  * a singleton `Nil` representing the empty list, and a `Cons` representing a non-empty list. Note the use of a case
  * object for the empty list, and a case class for the nonempty list.
  *
  * Note also that our implementation is polymorphic in the type of elements on the list. The `+` sign on the type
  * variable indicates that this implementation is _covariant_ in its type argument. This means that, for all pairs of
  * types `T1` and `T2`, if `T1` is a subtype of `T2`, then `List[T1]` is a subtype of `List[T2]`.
