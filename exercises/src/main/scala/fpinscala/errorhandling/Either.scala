  /**
    * Exercise 4.8
    *
    * In this implementation, map2 is only able to report one error, even if both the name and the
    * age are invalid. What would you need to change in order to report both errors? Would you
    * change map2 or the signature of mkPerson? Or could you create a new data type that captures
    * this requirement better than Either does, with some additional structure? How would orElse,
    * traverse, and sequence behave differently for that data type?
    *
    * ==Answer==
    * If we want to accumulate multiple errors, a simple approach would be a new data type that
    * allows us to keep a list of errors in the constructor that represents failures:
    *
    * {{{
    *   trait Partial[+A, +B]
    *   case class Errors[+A](get: Seq[A]) extends Partial[A, Nothing]
    *   case class Success[+B](get: B) extends Partial[Nothing, B]
    * }}}
    *
    * We would need to implement map, map2, sequence, and so on for this type in such a way as to
    * accumulate errors when possible. Interestingly, flatMap cannot be written in such a way,
    * because it short-circuits on failure cases, making it impossible to collect multiple failures.
