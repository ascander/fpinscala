  /*
   * There are a number of variations on `Option` and `Either`. If we want to accumulate multiple errors, a simple
   * approach is a new data type that lets us keep a list of errors in the data constructor that represents failures:
   *
   * trait Partial[+A,+B]
   * case class Errors[+A](get: Seq[A]) extends Partial[A,Nothing]
   * case class Success[+B](get: B) extends Partial[Nothing,B]
   *
   * There is a type very similar to this called `Validation` in the Scalaz library. You can implement `map`, `map2`,
   * `sequence`, and so on for this type in such a way that errors are accumulated when possible (`flatMap` is unable to
   * accumulate errors--can you see why?). This idea can even be generalized further--we don't need to accumulate
   * failing values into a list; we can accumulate values using any user-supplied binary function.
   *
   * It's also possible to use `Either[List[E],_]` directly to accumulate errors, using different implementations of
   * helper functions like `map2` and `sequence`.
